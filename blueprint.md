# SMWX YouTube Channel

## Overview

This is a web application that provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and watching episodes from the SMWX YouTube channel. It's built with the latest version of Angular, showcasing modern web development techniques and a sleek, responsive design.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Initial Version

*   **Layout**: A two-column layout with the video player and episode details on the left, and the episode playlist on the right.
*   **Styling**: A modern, dark theme with a clean and intuitive user interface. It uses CSS variables for easy theming and customization.
*   **Header**: A simple header with the channel name and a theme toggle.
*   **Video Player**: An embedded YouTube video player that dynamically loads the selected episode.
*   **Episode Details**: Displays the title and description of the selected episode.
*   **Playlist**: A list of episodes fetched from a YouTube playlist, allowing users to select a video to watch.
*   **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to smaller screen sizes, stacking the video player and playlist vertically.

## Current Plan

### Phase 1: MVP

1.  **Latest Episode Hero**: Create a prominent "hero" section for the most recent episode, allowing users to watch it directly on the page and share it with a single click.
2.  **Episodes Catalog**: Build a comprehensive catalog of all episodes, displayed in a clean grid or list format. The episodes will be sorted with the newest ones first, and I'll implement an infinite scroll for a seamless browsing experience.
3.  **Clips & Highlights**: Add a dedicated section to showcase shorter clips and highlight reels, making it easy for users to catch up on the key moments.
